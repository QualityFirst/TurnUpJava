  As an admin user of the TurnUp portal
  I would like to create, edit and delete
  time and material records successfully
  so that I can manage employee data correctly

  @regression
  Scenario: 1 Create time record with valid data
    Given I logged into TurnUp portal successfully
    When I navigate to Time and Material page
    When I create a time record
    Then the record should be created successfully

  Scenario Outline: 2 edit existing time record with valid data
    Given I logged into TurnUp portal successfully
    When I navigate to Time and Material page
    When I update the '<Code>' and '<Description>' on an existing Time record
    Then the record should have the updated '<Code>' and '<Description>'

    Examples:
      | Code               | Description     |
      | N-Industry Connect | N-1-Description |
      | N-TA Job Ready     | N-2-Description |
      | N-EditedRecord     | N-3-Description |

  Scenario: 3 delete existing time record
    Given I logged into TurnUp portal successfully
    When I navigate to Time and Material page
    When I delete an existing record
    Then the record should not be present on the table
